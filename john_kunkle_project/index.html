        <h2>Dota 2</h2>
        <div id="intro">
            <p class="two">Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena video game and the stand-alone sequel to the <abbr title="DOTA">Defense of the
                Ancients</abbr> (DotA) Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod. Developed by
                Valve Corporation, <em>Dota</em> 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in
                July 2013, concluding a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011. The game is available
                exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam.
            </p>

            <p class="two">Dota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two teams of five players, each of which occupies a stronghold
                at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the "Ancient", which the opposite team must
                destroy to win the match. Each player controls a "Hero" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold,
                acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.
            </p>
            <p class="two">Development of <strong>Dota 2</strong> began in 2009, when the developer of the DotA mod, IceFrog, was hired by Valve as
                lead designer. <em>Dota 2</em> was praised by critics for its gameplay, production quality and faithfulness to its
                predecessor. However, the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. Dota
                2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players.

        <h2 id="t">Tournaments</h2>

        <article id = "tor">
            <figure id = intPic><a id="intPica" href="images/dota2_int.jpg"><img src="images/dota2_int_Small.jpg" alt="dota 2 international"></a><figcaption>Dota 2 International, 2014</figcaption></figure>

            <p class = "one">To ensure that enough DotA players would take up Dota 2 and showcase the game's capabilities, Valve
                sponsored sixteen accomplished DotA teams to compete at The International for a one million dollar prize.
                The International became an annual championship tournament, with the venue changing to Seattle, Washington,
                United States. In 2012, the tournament was hosted during PAX Prime,with Chinese team Invictus Gaming
                going on to defeat the defending champions, Natus Vincere. In its third year, The International had a prize
                pool of over $2.8 million, thus reclaiming its previous title as having the largest prize pool in electronic
                sports history from League of Legends (at the Season 2 World Championship). The 2013 championship was
                won by the Swedish team Alliance, whose prize exceeded $1.4 million USD. The fourth iteration of
                The International took place at KeyArena in Seattle between July 18 and July 21, 2014, with the Chinese team
                NewBee becoming the new champions. Due to the funds raised by interactive compendium sales, the overall prize
                pool was elevated to over $10.9 million, the largest in the history of electronic sports.
            </p>
            <p class = "one">Following the inaugural event of The International, several electronic sports tournaments began to transition
                from DotA to Dota 2, including the Electronic Sports World Cup. DreamHack would also support Dota 2 in
                2011, following a year without support for the original, on account of the other multiplayer online battle
                arena titles Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends. By the end of its first year in its beta phase,
                Dota 2 was one of the highest-paying eSport titles of 2011, second only to StarCraft II. Dota 2 began as an
                official title for the World Cyber Games annual event in 2012. The Electronic Sports League began a seasonal
                tournament for Dota 2 called the RaidCall EMS One in 2013, which was the largest independent tournament for
                Dota 2 by the beginning of 2013. Beginning in September 2013, the Association of China E-sports began a
                Dota 2 tournament called the WPC ACE Dota 2 League, which had the largest grand prize by a third-party in
                electronic sports history and the largest prize pool for Dota 2 beyond The International. On June 12, 2013,
                at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, Nexon announced the investment of two billion South Korea won,
                (approximately 1.7 million USD), into amateur and professional leagues in South Korea for 2013, to coincide with
                the launch of their distribution agreement in the fall of that year. Erik Johnson commented in an interview
                that the implementation of the game's LAN feature was intended to promote smaller, independent competitions and
                local tournaments.
            </p>

            <p class = "one">As of February 1, 2015, over $25 million in prize money has been awarded through Dota 2 tournaments, with eight
                Dota 2 players winning the most money across all competitive video games.
